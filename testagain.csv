A1BG,Alpha-1-B glycoprotein; Immunoglobulin like domain containing
A1CF,"APOBEC1 complementation factor; Essential component of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme complex which is responsible for the postranscriptional editing of a CAA codon for Gln to a UAA codon for stop in APOB mRNA. Binds to APOB mRNA and is probably responsible for docking the catalytic subunit, APOBEC1, to the mRNA to allow it to deaminate its target cytosine. The complex also protects the edited APOB mRNA from nonsense-mediated decay; RNA binding motif containing"
A2M,"C3 and PZP-like alpha-2-macroglobulin domain-containing protein 5; Is able to inhibit all four classes of proteinases by a unique 'trapping' mechanism. This protein has a peptide stretch, called the 'bait region' which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region, a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase; C3 and PZP like, alpha-2-macroglobulin domain containing"
A2ML1,"C3 and PZP-like alpha-2-macroglobulin domain-containing protein 9; Is able to inhibit all four classes of proteinases by a unique 'trapping' mechanism. This protein has a peptide stretch, called the 'bait region' which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase (By similarity). Displays inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin, papain, thermolysin, subtilisin A and, to a lesser extent, elastase but not trypsin. May play an important role during desquamation by inhibiting extracellular proteases; Belongs to the protease inhibitor I39 (alpha-2- macroglobulin) family."
A3GALT2,"Alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2; Synthesizes the galactose-alpha(1,3)-galactose group on the glycosphingolipid isoglobotrihexosylceramide or isogloboside 3 (iGb3) by catalyzing the transfer of galactose from UDP-Galactose to its acceptor molecule Gal-beta-1,4-Glc-ceramide. Can also catalyze the addition of galactose to iGb3 itself to form polygalactose structures; Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 6 family."
A4GALT,"UDP-galactose:beta-D-galactosyl-beta1-R 4-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase; Necessary for the biosynthesis of the Pk antigen of blood histogroup P. Catalyzes the transfer of galactose to lactosylceramide and galactosylceramide. Necessary for the synthesis of the receptor for bacterial verotoxins; Alpha 1,4-glycosyltransferases"
A4GNT,"Alpha-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; Catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to core 2 branched O-glycans. Necessary for the synthesis of type III mucin which is specifically produced in the stomach, duodenum, and pancreatic duct. May protect against inflammation-associated gastric adenocarcinomas (By similarity); Alpha 1,4-glycosyltransferases"
AAAS,"Achalasia, adrenocortical insufficiency, alacrimia; Plays a role in the normal development of the peripheral and central nervous system; Nucleoporins"
AACS,Acyl-CoA synthetase family member 1; Activates acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA. May be involved in utilizing ketone body for the fatty acid-synthesis during adipose tissue development (By similarity); Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme family.
AADAC,"Arylacetamide deacetylase; Displays cellular triglyceride lipase activity in liver, increases the levels of intracellular fatty acids derived from the hydrolysis of newly formed triglyceride stores and plays a role in very low-density lipoprotein assembly. Displays serine esterase activity in liver. Deacetylates a variety of arylacetamide substrates, including xenobiotic compounds and procarcinogens, converting them to the primary arylamide compounds and increasing their toxicity; Arylacetamide deacetylase family"
